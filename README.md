when i use jenkins pipeline: 
1-by ec2-user pvt key and remote ansivble_user as ansible bcs ssh-key gen already completed
3.110.148.133 ansible_user=ansible

2-by remote user username and password,no need of remote sever username mentioned in inventory
3.110.148.133 ansible_user=ansible
or 
3.110.148.133 
both works fine if we use remote server username nd password in jenkins
